# Privacy Policy for tday.ai

_Last updated: 5/1/2023_

Josh Robinson ("I", "me", or "my") operates the tday.ai mobile application (the "Service"). Your privacy is important to me, and I am committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of information I collect, why I collect it, how I use it, and how I protect it.

## 1. Information Collection and Use

The tday.ai app may collect and process micro journal entries, which could contain personal information. The app is designed to respect your privacy and to maintain the confidentiality of your information.

### (a) Micro Journal Entries

While using the tday.ai app, you may choose to create and store micro journal entries. These entries may include personal information, which will be treated with the utmost care and respect for your privacy.

### (b) Data Sharing with OpenAI

When you use the AI feature within the tday.ai app, your micro journal entries may be sent to OpenAI for processing. I do not have access to this data. The security and privacy of your data shared with OpenAI are governed by OpenAI's privacy policy and terms of service.

## 2. Data Storage

The tday.ai app processes micro journal entries on your device. Your micro journal entries may be stored on your iCloud account if you choose to enable iCloud storage. Please note that I do not control or have access to the data stored on your iCloud account. The security and privacy of your iCloud-stored data are governed by Apple's privacy policy and terms of service.

## 3. Data Security

The security of your personal information, including micro journal entries, is important to me. While no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, I strive to protect your data to the best of my ability.

## 4. Disclosure of Data

Given that the tday.ai app processes micro journal entries on your device and does not transmit or store any data outside of it (with the exception of data shared with OpenAI when using the AI feature), there is no personal data to disclose. However, if necessary to provide the Service, certain non-personal data may be shared with third-party companies. This will only be done in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and with the aim of improving the Service.

## 5. Links to Other Sites

The tday.ai app may contain links to other sites that are not operated by me. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.
